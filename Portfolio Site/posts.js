            "The image I chose above relates to the article as it shows the importance of listening to the stories that are told to you. Mary Ellen Mark was all about making the invisible visible, she did not hide from unique stories, she listened to even the most abnormal subjects, and through capturing their story, she could tell a story of her own.",
            "'In Africa, the Art of Listening', tells of Henning Makell, the author, and his experiences and observations since moving from Sweden to Africa. He explains he has lived there for 25 years, and compares the noisy, self-centered views of Western culture with the African emphasis on connection and listening to others. Mankell makes the prediction that African literature and stories will become more apparent in Western culture in coming years, which he was of course correct about, considering films like Black Panther and Get Out, which focus on both African and African American culture and traditions or books like Black Leopard, Red Wolf, a fantasy book set in a world inspired by African mythology. Let's The purpose of this article is mainly to emphasize the importance of listening to each other, as well as expressing our ideas, satires, dreams, etc. Mankell wraps up with a hopeful quote about the importance of seeking others to listen, using our emerging imprint on the universe or potential alien civilizations to inspire the reader that this simple idea may have major implications.",
            "I enjoyed this article, as it told a very unique story that few can tell. There are not many people who would spontaneously move to an unknown country, and even fewer who would stay for 25 years. Mankell's observations are very interesting and important, as they illustrate ideas that the Western world can learn from. As we enter this age of intense globalization, understanding our fellow members of Earth has become more important than ever. We have the opportunity to all learn from each other and prepare humanity for positive progress. The reference to the parable of why humans have one mouth but two ears was very interesting for this reason. I can't think of any Western myths, nursery rhymes, or stories that have this concept. It provides a great example of how African stories can have lessons that Western stories might not.",
            "I don't feel there was anything controversial about this article. I guess maybe he uses 'Africa' in a pretty vague way when in reality he's only discussing his experiences in Mozambique. I thought overall the article was well-written and respectful of the cultures he was discussing.",
            "This article is relevant in regard to documentary photography as it describes a story of documentation and has a message that is relevant to the field. Mankell discusses his life, being assimilated into a vastly different culture. He illustrates respect for the cultures and traditions he discusses, which is highly important when encroaching on a space, especially in such a delicate context. The importance of listening, illustrated in the article, reflects documentary photography as it is a vital aspect of the field. A photographer is a listener, the camera is the ear, and the language is through image. We can take the lessons from the article and use them in documentary photography by being respectful and insightful when taking images. We should understand our subjects so that we can craft an accurate portrait of them to the world. We want to respect and preserve the unpredictable nature of reality and the truth surrounding our subjects, or else it isn't documentary at all."
